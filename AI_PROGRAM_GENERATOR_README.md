# AI Program Generator Implementation

## Overview
Successfully implemented an AI-powered program generator that creates personalized training programs based on user's DUPR rating and focus skills selected during onboarding.

## Features Implemented

### 1. AI Program Generation Logic (`src/lib/aiProgramGenerator.js`)
- **Database Integration**: Queries real exercises from Supabase with DUPR range and skill matching
- **Smart Filtering**: Filters exercises based on user's DUPR rating and selected focus areas
- **Program Structure**: Creates 2 routines with 3-4 exercises each, as requested
- **Difficulty Scaling**: Adjusts exercise difficulty based on DUPR rating
- **Exercise Distribution**: Intelligently distributes exercises across routines for progression

### 2. UI Integration (`src/screens/ProgramScreen.js`)
- **New Button**: Added "Generate Your AI Program" button with ðŸ¤– icon
- **Placement**: Button appears below the empty state text and above "Create Custom Program"
- **Loading State**: Shows "Generating..." when AI is processing
- **Success Flow**: Shows alert with option to view generated program immediately

### 3. User Validation
- **DUPR Rating**: Requires valid DUPR rating (2.0-8.0)
- **Focus Areas**: Requires at least one focus skill selected during onboarding
- **Onboarding Check**: Validates user has completed necessary onboarding steps

## How It Works

### Step 1: User Data Collection
- DUPR rating from onboarding/profile
- Focus areas (skills) selected during onboarding
- User name and tier information

### Step 2: Exercise Matching
```sql
-- Queries exercises that match user's DUPR range
SELECT * FROM exercises 
WHERE is_published = true 
AND (
  (dupr_range_min <= user_rating AND dupr_range_max >= user_rating) 
  OR (dupr_range_min IS NULL AND dupr_range_max IS NULL)
)
```

### Step 3: Skill Filtering
- Filters exercises by matching skill categories with user's focus areas
- Uses flexible matching (contains/includes logic)
- Falls back to general exercises if no specific matches

### Step 4: Program Creation
- **Routine 1**: "Foundation & Fundamentals" (4 exercises, 45 min)
- **Routine 2**: "Advanced Skills & Strategy" (3 exercises, 50 min)
- Smart exercise distribution to avoid duplicates
- Difficulty progression from foundation to advanced

## Database Requirements

### Exercise Schema
The AI generator expects exercises to have:
- `dupr_range_min` and `dupr_range_max` (DECIMAL)
- `skill_categories_json` (JSONB array) or `skill_category` (TEXT)
- `difficulty` (INTEGER 1-5)
- `is_published` (BOOLEAN)

### User Schema
Requires users to have:
- `dupr_rating` (DECIMAL)
- `focus_areas` (JSONB array)

## Skill Mapping

The system maps these skill IDs from onboarding:
- `dinks` â†’ Dink exercises
- `drives` â†’ Drive exercises  
- `serves` â†’ Serve exercises
- `returns` â†’ Return exercises
- `volleys` â†’ Volley/Reset exercises
- `lobs` â†’ Lob exercises
- `drops` â†’ Drop shot exercises
- And 20+ more technical, movement, strategic, and physical skills

## Error Handling

1. **No User Data**: Shows alert explaining onboarding requirement
2. **Invalid DUPR**: Requests valid rating in profile
3. **No Focus Areas**: Requests skill selection in onboarding
4. **No Exercises**: Shows database/connection error
5. **Generation Failure**: Shows generic error with retry option

## Integration Points

### UserContext
- Reads `user.duprRating` and `user.focus_areas`
- Uses `user.name` and `user.tier` for program customization

### ProgramScreen State  
- Integrates with existing `programs` state array
- Uses existing `setPrograms` function to add generated program
- Leverages existing `navigateToProgram` for immediate viewing

## Usage Flow

1. User completes onboarding with DUPR rating and focus skills
2. User navigates to Programs tab
3. User taps "Generate Your AI Program" button
4. System validates user data
5. AI queries database for matching exercises
6. System creates 2-routine program structure
7. Program is added to local programs list
8. User gets success alert with "View Program" option

## Benefits

- **Personalized**: Uses real user data for customization
- **Database-Driven**: Uses actual exercises, not static data
- **Scalable**: Works with any number of exercises in database
- **Progressive**: Creates logical skill progression
- **Integrated**: Seamlessly fits into existing UI/UX

## Technical Notes

- No local storage needed - programs stored in React state
- Database queries use Supabase client with error handling
- Follows existing app patterns for consistency
- Uses existing styling system for UI components
- Maintains compatibility with current program structure
